# Computer Vision
Hi

Thanks for visiting my Computer Vision respository.

In this repository, I use

1. CIFAR image dataset to classify 10 different everyday objects with Neural network (NN)
2. CIFAR image dataset to classify 10 different everyday objects with Convolutional neural network (CNN)
3. a dataset to classify cats and dogs with CNN
4. VGG16 model to classify cats and dogs with dropout & imagedatagenerator
5. VGG16 model to classify a dog and a piano
6. MobileNetV2 model to classify cats and dogs
7. fashion_mnist dataset to classify types of clothes with NN
8. mnist dataset to classify handwritten numbers with NN
9. mnist dataset to classify handwritten numbers with CNN

This tutorial is from the freecodecamp & 2 day courses.
