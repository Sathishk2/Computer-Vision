# Computer Vision
Hi

Thanks for visiting my Computer Vision respository.

In this repository, I learn how to classify 10 different everyday objects using the CIFAR image dataset. 

1. Use CNN with 3 layers
2. add dense layers
3. train and evaulate the model
4. Augment the data 

This tutorial is from the freecodecamp course.
